1|1|In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
1|2|Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds,
1|3|The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,
1|4|Master of the Day of Judgement.
1|5|You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] we ask for help;
1|6|Guide us to the straight path,
1|7|The path of those whom You have blessed; not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
2|1|Alif. Lam. Meem.
2|2|This is the Book about which there is no doubt; in it is guidance for those who fear Allah,
2|3|Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;
2|4|And who believe in the Revelation sent down to you, and in what was sent before your time, and believe with certainty in the hereafter.
2|5|It is they who are following guidance from their Lord and it is they who will prosper.
