1|1|In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
1|2|Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds,
1|3|The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,
1|4|Master of the Day of Judgement.
1|5|You [alone] we worship, and You [alone] we ask for help;
1|6|Guide us to the straight path,
1|7|The path of those whom You have blessed; not of those who have incurred Your wrath, nor of those who have gone astray.
2|1|Alif. Lam. Meem.
2|2|This is the Book about which there is no doubt; in it is guidance for those who fear Allah,
2|3|Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them;
2|4|And who believe in the Revelation sent down to you, and in what was sent before your time, and believe with certainty in the hereafter.
2|5|It is they who are following guidance from their Lord and it is they who will prosper.
2|6|As for those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them; they will not believe.
2|7|Allah has placed a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and over their eyes is a cover; theirs will be a severe penalty.
2|8|Among people there are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, but in fact they are not believers.
2|9|They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they are not deceiving anyone except themselves, although they do not realise.
2|10|In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease. Theirs will be a painful penalty for their persistent lying.
2|11|When it is said to them: Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We only want to put things right.
2|12|Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they do not realise.
2|13|When it is said to them: Believe as the people believe, they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Indeed it is they who are the fools, but they do not know.
2|14|When they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they are alone with their devils, they say: We are really with you; we were only mocking.
2|15|Allah is mocking them, and gives them free rein in transgression so that they wander blindly.
2|16|These are the ones who have traded guidance for error, but their trade brings no profit and they are not guided.
2|17|Their likeness is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it illuminated all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness, unable to see.
2|18||Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return [to the right path],
2|19|Or [another likeness] is that of a heavy downpour from the sky, accompanied by darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, for fear of death. But Allah encompasses the disbelievers.
2|20|The lightning almost snatches away their sight; every time it flashes, they walk [a few steps] therein, but when the darkness overtakes them again, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could take away their hearing and their sight; for Allah has power over all things.
