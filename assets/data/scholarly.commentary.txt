1|1|Ibn Uthaymeen||Authentic Translations|The statement of Allah, *In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy* contains a preposition and an object of the preposition which are both actually connected to a delayed, missing verb appropriate to the situation in which the Basmalah5 is used. For example, if you say, “In the name of Allah,” while you are beginning to eat, then the meaning with the missing verb included would be, “In the name of Allah, I eat.” # We say there must be a connected missing verb because a preposition and the object of the preposition, in Arabic, must both refer to an action. This delayed action or verb is deferred until after mentioning the name of Allah for two benefits: first, to seek the blessing of mentioning Allah’s name first and foremost; and second, a delayed action indicates that it is restricted, as if you are saying, “I do not eat in the name of anyone, and I do not seek blessings and help by any name except with the name of Allah.” # We say that the delayed missing word is a verb because action words are verbs and this is known to the specialists of Arabic grammar. So because of this, nouns do not apply except with specific conditions. # We also say that it (the deferred, missing verb) is appropriate to the situation in which the statement is made because the statement itself indicates the intended verb which is according to the situation. For example, Allah’s messenger specified the verb when he said: *Whoever has not already slaughtered (his animal), then let him slaughter in the name of Allah.* (Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 985) and Muslim (no. 1970)). # Or he said: *…upon the name of Allah.* (Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 5500) and Muslim (no. 1970)) # *Allah* (Allāh): “Allah” is the proper name for the lord of all the creations. No one else is named with this name. It is the base origin of all the other names (of Allah) and all of them follow and describe this name.* # *the Most-Merciful* (ar-Raḥmān): This proper name of Allah means, “the one who is described with expansive, all-encompassing mercy.” Even the Arabic root form of the word that this name is based on indicates a sense of expansiveness according to the rules of Arabic conjugation. # *The Bestower of all mercy* (ar-Raḥīm): This is another name meaning, “the one who bestows mercy on whomever he wills of his servants.” The Arabic form of the word here indicates the occurrence of the action. # So here, mercy is one of Allah’s characteristics and attributes indicated by the name, “ar-Raḥmān.” Mercy also relates to Allah’s action – bestowing mercy on the creation – and this is indicated by his name “ar-Raḥīm.” # ar-Raḥmān and ar-Raḥīm are both actual names of Allah with which he describes himself. They prove the attribute of mercy and its associated effect. This attribute of mercy that Allah has affirmed for himself is an actual characteristic of mercy as is proven by the Islamic legislation and the intellect. As for the legislative proofs, they are those which have come in the Quran or the Sunnah confirming the attribute of Allah’s mercy and there are many proofs like this. As for the intellect, then whatever occurs of favors and whatever adversity is prevented, these are only the effects of Allah’s mercy. # Even after this, some people still deny and reject the idea of describing Allah with a real, actual characteristic of mercy. They distort its meaning and misinterpret it to mean “the bestowing of favors” or the “intent to bestow favors.” They claim that it is impossible for one’s intellect to describe Allah with mercy mistakenly saying, “…because mercy is a swaying emotion consisting of softness, humbleness, and sympathy. Such things do not befit Allah!” This statement of theirs is refuted in two ways:
1|1|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|Al-Ibaanah.com|“Bismillaah-ir-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem” (In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy) is a request for blessing and assistance. # What is meant by this is that a Muslim says Bismillaah seeking blessing from Allaah’s Name and seeking assistance in Allaah for his recitation. This applies also to anything for which he mentions Allaah’s Name prior to doing it. He is stating Allaah’s Name in order to seek blessing and assistance (by it). # He should recite the Bismillaah silently even though it is an ayah from the Qur’an. Is it an ayah in every surah (chapter) or is it just an independent ayah used as a divider between surahs? And is it an ayah in Surah Al-Faatihah or is it not part of the surah at all? The scholars have many opinions on this. What indicates that it is part of the Qur’an is that the Companions included it in the mushaf and they didn’t include anything in there except for the Qur’an. # It is reported in the Sunan of Abu Dawood with an authentic chain (788) that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: *The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was not aware of the separation of a surah until Bismillaah-ir-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem was revealed to him.* # There is no disagreement amongst the scholars over the fact that the Bismillaah is part of an ayah within Surah An-Naml. # Surah Al-Faatihah consists of seven verses. Those scholars that believe that it is an ayah in Surah Al-Faatihah count the Bismillaah as being one of the seven verses. Those who believe that it is not part of Al-Faatihah make the seventh verse: *“Not of those who earned Your wrath nor of those who went astray.”* # From the proofs that are used to indicate that the Bismillaah is not an ayah from Al-Faatihah is the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement in the qudsee hadeeth: *“I have divided the Prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, and My servant will have what he asks for. # So when the servant says: ‘Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabbil-‘Aalameen’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has praised Me…’”* [Reported by Muslim from Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) (395)]. So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not mention the Bismillaah in it.
1|2|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|“Al-Hamdulillaah” (All praise is for Allaah): “Hamd” means praise. The definite article (Al) before Hamd is for including all the commendable acts He does. As for the good things that one has no role in bringing about, such as beauty and so on, then praising that is called madah and not hamd. # The servants’ praising of their Lord is worship and it falls under Tawheed-ul-Uloohiyyah, which is the Oneness of Allaah in His servants actions (i.e. worship). Allaah is the One deserving of praise and commendation for every blessing that the servants achieve regardless if one of the servants played a part in it or not. This is since all of the credit in that matter belongs to Allaah, as He says: “And whatever blessings you have, it is from Allaah.”[Surah An-Nahl: 53] # In his advice to Ibn ‘Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “And know that if the entire ummah were to gather together to bring you some benefit, they would not be able to benefit you except with something that Allaah has already decreed for you.” # So therefore all commendable acts in reality belong to Allaah. So He alone is the One who deserves praise in every circumstance. And as for the servants, whatever good things they do out of their own free will and choice, such as nobility, kindness and doing good deeds, then they should be praised and lauded for that. And whatever good that is in them, which they played no part in producing, such as beauty and good appearance, then they should be commended for it but not praised. # “Rabb-il-‘Aalameen” (Lord of all that is created): Rabb means the One who is worshipped, the Creator, the Sustainer, the King, the One who administers and brings up all of the creation through His favors. With regard to‘Aalameen, everything that is apart from Allaah then that is considered ‘Aalam. He is the Lord of everyone and everything. # This consists of Oneness of Allaah in His Lordship, Names and Attributes since Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah means the Oneness of Allaah in His Actions. So He is One in His creating, sustaining, giving of life, and causing of death. He has no partners in His Lordship nor does He have any partner in His Worship. To Allaah belong the most perfect of Names and Attributes. Two of Allaah’s names have been mentioned in this ayah: “All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all that is created.” They are Allaah and Ar-Rabb. In another ayah, Allaah says: “Salaam – a word from the Lord (Rabb), Most Merciful.” [Surah Ya Sin: 58]
1|3|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad||“Ar-Rahmaan” (The Most Merciful): means He grants a general mercy for all of the created beings. “Ar-Raheem” (The Bestower of Mercy): means He gives a specified mercy for just the believers. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: “And He is ever an All-Bestower of mercy to the believers.” [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 43] # Ar-Rahmaan and Ar-Raheem are two of Allaah’s names that indicate one of His Attributes, which is mercy. All of Allaah’s names are derivatives that indicate meanings, which are attributes. So an attribute from among His many Attributes can be extracted from every one of Allaah’s Names. # The name Ar-Rahmaan is more general than Ar-Raheem and it cannot be applied to anyone except for Allaah. So it can’t be said to someone that he is Rahmaan. But as for Raheem, it can be applied to Allaah as well as others. Allaah said about His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): “Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He is anxious over you. For the believers, he is full of pity, kind and merciful (raheem).” [Surah At-Tawbah: 128]
1|4|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|“Maaliki-Yawm-id-Deen” (Master of the Day of Judgement): refers to the Day of Reward, Recompense and Accountability, the Day when everyone will be compensated for his deeds – if they are good, then there will be good (for him) and if they are evil, then there will be evil (for him). The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: “And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? (It will be) The Day when no person shall have power (to do anything) for another, and the decision that Day will be wholly with Allaah.” [Surah Al-Infitaar: 17-19] # There is also the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): “The shrewd person is the one who subjects himself and works for what comes after death. And the feeble person is the one who allows his soul to follow its vain desires, while aspiring for Allaah to grant his ambitions.” # Allaah is the Owner of everything. He is the Owner of the worldly life and the Hereafter. Allaah has only particularized the Day of Recompense here as Him being the Owner of it because it is the day in which all of the created beings will submit themselves to the Lord of all that exists. This is contrary to the worldly life for there can be found in it those who are insolent and haughty and who say such things as “I am your lord, most high” and“I didn’t know you had a god besides me!” # The hadeeth mentioned by the author was reported by At-Tirmidhee (2459) and its chain of narration contains Abu Bakr bin Abee Maryam who is weak.
1|5|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|“Iyyaaka Na’budu” (You alone do we worship): meaning we don’t worship anyone except You. This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not worship anyone besides Him. # “Wa Iyyaaka Nasta’een” (And in You alone do we seek assistance): This is a covenant between the servant and his Lord that he will not seek the assistance of anyone besides Allaah. # Allaah says: “And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.” [Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56] # When you place the object of the verb (You alone) before the verb (we worship) in issues of worship and seeking assistance, this indicates a limitation and particularization. So you are limiting the worship to only Allaah and particularizing Him alone by it. So no one is worshipped except Allaah and no one’s assistance is sought except for Allaah’s. # Therefore, a servant (of Allaah) does not ask assistance from the angels or the jinn or anyone absent. But as for him asking assistance from a person that is present and who is able to assist him and help him achieve the benefit or repel the harm, this is permissible and not forbidden.
1|6|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|“Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem” (Guide us to the Straight Path) means direct us, show us the way and keep us firm on as-Siraat (the Path), meaning Islaam. It is also believed that it refers to the Messenger and likewise that it refers to the Qur’aan. All of these meanings are true. What is meant by Mustaqeem (Straight) is that which has no deviations in it. # The people’s need for being guided to the Straight Path is greater than all of their other needs. And their requirement of it is above any other requirement they may have. Their need for it is greater than their need for food and drink since food and drink are only means for them to continue remaining in this worldly life. But as for their being guided to the Straight Path, then it is a cause for their success and happiness in both this worldly life and the Hereafter. # Asking to be guided to the Straight Path consists of requesting Allaah to direct and show you to the path of truth and guidance. It also entails asking Him to grant you the ability follow this Straight Path. When a servant asks his Lord in every rak’ah (unit) of the prayer to guide him to the Straight Path, this entails asking Him to keep him firm upon whatever he achieves from guidance. It also entails asking for an increased and additional guidance, as Allaah says: “And as for those who are guided, He increases them in guidance and gives to them their Taqwaa (dutifulness).” [Surah Muhammad: 17] # There is no contradiction between interpreting “Guide us” to mean “show us, “direct us” or “keep us firm” nor with interpreting the “Straight Path” to mean “Islaam”, “the Messenger” or “the Qur’aan because that is only a difference of diversity and not a difference of contrast. This is why the author went on to say: “All of these meanings are true.” The interpretations of the Salaf are for the most part like this. Either their interpretation is by way of words that are close in meaning, which are all true and don’t contradict each other, as is the case here, or it is by way of example, which is done by interpreting a general word to mean some of the parts that fall under it, such as Allaah’s saying: “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good.” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 201] # There is no contradiction in interpreting the “good” of this world to mean a righteous wife or a righteous child or pure wealth. This falls under interpreting by way of example.
1|7|Abdul-Muhsin Al-Abbad|Sharh Shuroot-is-Salaat pg. 48-61, Dar-ul-Imam Ahmad|“Siraat-aladheena An’amta ‘alayhim” (The Path of those You bestowed Your Favor on): meaning the way of those who have received your Bounty. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: “And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Favor, such as the prophets, the first to believe (in the prophets), the martyrs and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!” [Surah An-Nisaa: 69] # “Ghayr-il-Maghdoobi ‘alayhim” (Not those who earned Your Anger): They are the Jews since they have knowledge but do not act on it. You are asking Allaah to protect you from their way. # “Wa laad-Daalleen” {Nor of those who went astray): This refers to the Christians, who worship Allaah based on ignorance and misguidance. You are asking Allaah to protect you from their way. The proof for those who went astray is Allaah’s saying: “Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers with respect to their deeds? Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds.” [Surah Al-Kahf: 103-105] # And there is also the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): “You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you, in exactly the same manner, to the point that if they were to enter the hole of a lizard, you would also enter it.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and the Christians?” He said: “Who else?” Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim reported it. # And the second hadeeth is: “The Jews split up into seventy-one sects and the Christians split up into seventy-two sects. And this ummah (of Muslims) will split up into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except for one.” They said: “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “Those who are upon the same way that I and my Companions are upon.”  # The Straight Path that a Muslim asks his Lord to guide him to is the path of those whom Allaah bestowed His Grace upon, such as the prophets, the siddeeqoon (first true believers), the martyrs and the righteous people, as Allaah says: “And verily, this is my Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow the other paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you so that you may become dutiful (Muttaqoon).” [Surah Al-An’aam: 153] # He asks Allaah in every one of the rak’aat (units) of his prayer to direct him to the path of truth and guidance and to protect him from the path of those who are astray and in error, such as the Jews and Christians. # The hadeeth: “You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you…” was reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7320) and Muslim (2669) from Abu Sa’eed. Its first part is found in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree with the wording: “You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you hand-span by hand-span and forearm by forearm…” and in Saheeh Muslim with the wording: “You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you inch by inch and cubit by cubit.” # The hadeeth about the splitting of the ummah has been reported by a group of the Prophet’s Companions. For the referencing of this hadeeth, see the comments to hadeeth no. 16937 in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. Also seeSilsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah of Al-Albaanee (203-204) who quoted its authenticity on Ibn Taimiyyah, Ash-Shaatibee and Al-‘Iraaqee. # What is meant by the word “ummah” in this hadeeth is the ummah (nation of people) that have responded to the Call. These seventy-three sects are Muslims. The “Saved Sect” are those who are upon what the Prophet and his Companions were upon. Seventy-two of the sects are under the threat of being placed in the Hellfire due to their deviating from the path of truth. Their affair is up to Allaah – if He wishes, He will punish them and if He wishes, He will pardon them. # As for the ummah (nation of people) that requires the Call, they consist of every human being and Jinn from the time of the Prophet’s advent to the establishment of the Hour. Those who fall in this category are the Jews, the Christians and all of the other religions of disbelief. This is based on the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement: “By the One in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one from this ummah (nation of people) hears about me, whether he is a Jew or a Christian, then dies without believing in what I was sent with, except that he will be from the inhabitants of the Hellfire.” [Reported by Muslim (386) from Abu Hurairah; Also see the Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-Islaam (7/218) and Fataawaa al-Lajnat-ud-Daa’imah (2/157)]
2|18|Ibn 'Uthaymeen|Fatawa Islamiyah, Vol.7, No.124|Question: # What is the explanation of the verse : *They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not* (Al-Baqarah 2:18) ? # Answer: # These are three qualities that Allah Almighty described the hypocrites with – deaf, they do not listen to or hear the truth; dumb, they do not speak the truth; blind, they do not see what the truth is nor do they see by the truth. And because their senses are thus blocked from knowledge, they will not return from their wandering and from their hypocrisy.
2|256|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/408|Question: #Allah (Exalted be He) says, *There is no compulsion in religion.* [al-Baqarah: 256] Is this Ayah confined in application to the Jews and Christians or is it general in meaning? # Answer: # The scholars hold two different views on this Ayah. # First: it and its like are abrogated by the Ayah of the sword in which Allah says, *Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islâmic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikûn (See V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush.* [at-Tawbah:5] # And the other Ayahs which convey the same meaning such as Allah's Saying, *And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world].* [al-Anfal: 39] #Second: This Ayah addresses People of the Book and those who are equal to them, such as the Magi. If they pay Jizyah (poll tax required from non-Muslims living in an Islamic state), they should not be forced to accept Islam as Allah says, *Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allâh, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allâh and His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.* [at-Tawbah: 29] # The Prophet (peace be upon him) *received the Jizyah from the Magi of Hajar.* [1] # Therefore, this Ayah can not stand as a proof for those who claim that Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) is not an obligation. # Moreover, the Hadith of Buraydah ibn Al-Hasib that is related in Muslim's Sahih stresses this meaning. The Hadith says: *When the Prophet (peace be upon him) appointed anyone as the leader of an army or detachment, he would exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. At the end of the Prophet's advice, he (peace be upon him) said: If they (the disbelievers) refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizyah. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the Jizyah, seek Allah's Help, and fight them.* [2] # According to the majority of scholars, this is applied to the People of the Book and those who are regarded as equal to them such as the Magi, according to the majority of scholars as a means of reconciliation between the Hadith and the above mentioned Ayah in Surah Al-Tawbah and the like Ayahs. #Footnote: #[1]: Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on Jizyah, no. 3157; Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on military expeditions, no. 1586; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on tribute, rulership, and spoils, no. 3043; Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, p. 191; and Al-Darimy, Sunan, Book on military expeditions, no. 2501. #[2]: Muslim, Sahih, Book on Jihad and military expeditions, no. 1731; Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on military expeditions, no. 1617; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Jihad, no. 2612; Ibn Majah, Sunan, Book on Jihad, no. 2858; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, p. 358.
2|258|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 9/279|Question: #Please interpret the Saying of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He): *Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrâhîm (Abraham) about his Lord (Allâh), because Allâh had given him the kingdom? When Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said (to him): "My Lord (Allâh) is He Who gives life and causes death." He said, "I give life and cause death." Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, "Verily! Allâh brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west." So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allâh guides not the people, who are Zâlimûn (wrong-doers).* [al-Baqarah: 258] #Answer: #This Ayah (Qur'anic verse) is very clear to whoever contemplates it. Ibrahim, Khalil Al-Rahman (the close friend of Allah), was sent to call his people to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) and warn them against Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). At his time, there was a king, called Al-Namrudh, who claimed to be the lord of the worlds and was reportedly granted the reign of earth. The earth was ruled by four kings; two of them Kafirs (disbelievers), Al-Namrudh and Nebuchadnezzar, and two Muslims, Dhul-Qarnayn and Sulayman (Solomon), son of Dawud (David). #In brief, Al-Namrudh was a stubborn tyrant who claimed kingship and lordship of the worlds. He claimed that he was able to grant life and death; therefore, Ibrahim said to him, "My Lord (Allâh) is He Who gives life and causes death." The devilish Al-Namrudh said, "I give life and cause death." A number of Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur'an) mentioned that he brought before Ibrahim two persons sentenced to death and forgave one and killed the other and claimed that this was the meaning of giving life and causing death. He forgave the one sentenced to death and claimed that he gave him life. This is mere arrogance and deception; for this is not what Ibrahim meant; he meant bringing out a living creature from a dead stone, Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge) and earth. This could only be made by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). #Allah Alone brings forth plants and gives life to the Nutfah until it turns into sperms. What Ibrahim meant was that this could be done only by Allah. However, Al-Namrudh was arrogant and tried to deceive Ibrahim, so the latter sought another argument which was clearer to people, so that the former could not say a word. Ibrahim (peace be upon him) pointed out to Al-Namrudh that Allah causes the sun to rise in the east, so if he was a lord as he claimed he should cause it to rise in the west. Al-Namrudh was confounded and people got to know that his schemes were false and that he was a weak creature that could not cause the sun to rise in the west instead of the east. People got to know his falsehood and arrogance and the truth of what Ibrahim (peace be upon him) said.
3|6|Permanent Committee|Fatwas of the Permanent Committee No. 1542 Question 2|Question: #What is the Tafsir (explanation/exegesis) of the Ayah (Quranic Verse): *He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.* [Aal Imran, 3:6]? #Answer: #(In the preceding Ayahs) Allah (Exalted be He) describes Himself as being the One God, with no peer or partner, the Ever-Living Who never dies and the One Who sustains and protects all His creatures who cannot have any existence and their affairs cannot prosper and become upright without Allah’s Disposition, whereas Allah stands All-Rich, absolutely free of want, having no need of any of them. Allah is also the All-Knowing of everything, for nothing whatsoever on the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Him. (In the mentioned Ayah) He (Exalted be He) gives evidence for this by declaring that He alone creates people in the wombs of their mothers as He wills and according to the shape and state that He wants; males or females, handsome or ugly, wretched or happy. There is no deity but He, the Possessor of Glory and the absolutely perfect overruling Power. #He also has the Perfect Wisdom in all that He legislates, creates, judges and predestines, as His creation of 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) and His Will that his mother should conceive him without a father as a sign to mankind testifying to the absolute perfection of Allah’s Knowledge, Might and extensive Wisdom, just as He created Adam from dust and said unto him: "Be!" so he was according to what Allah willed. Therefore, these creatures have no right to be worshipped beside Allah, for worship is the exclusive Right of Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who has no partner. There is no deity but He, the Omnipotent, Who cannot be defeated and nothing whatsoever escapes Him. He is the All-Wise in His disposing of affairs, in His creation and in His legislation. #This also refutes the allegations of the Christians who allege that 'Isa is the son of Allah, because Allah is He who fashioned him in the womb of his mother Maryam. Therefore, how can he be Allah’s son or a deity with him! Glorified and High is Allah above the great falsehood that they say!
4|3|Permanent Committee|Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da'imah No. 6356 Question 4|Question: # Concerning the meaning of Allah's statement: *(the slaves) that your right hands possess.* [an-Nisa: 3] Is it permissible for the master to behave as he likes with those he possesses without any restrictions or accountability? Suppose that I own a maidservant and at the same time I own her husband, am I permitted to act as I like with them? What is the limit of my authority over them? # Answer: #In the Shari'ah (Islamic law) the phrase *(the slaves) that your right hands possess* [an-Nisa: 3]. Refers to what a person possesses including male and female bondservants and other property that a person legally owns. It is not permissible for the master of a male or female bondservant to treat them according to his desire or mere opinion; but he must be just as ordained by Shari'ah. He should use them in lawful works, which they have the ability to perform and he may have intercourse with his maidservant if she is not married. If she bears him a child, she becomes Umm Walad (mother of a child) and, therefore, she cannot be sold and becomes free when he dies. # Furthermore, her master cannot separate her from her child. There are many other regulations that Allah legislated in order to organize the relationship between a master and his bondservant girl and define what is lawful and what is forbidden.
4|145|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/49|Question: # Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book (what means): *Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire* [an-Nisa: 145] What is meant by hypocrisy and hypocrites in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse)? Please clarify their meaning. # Answer: # The hypocrites are those who make a false pretense of Islam, whereas they are hiding otherwise. They claim to be Muslims, although deep down they disbelieve in Allah and belie the Messenger (peace be upon him). These are the hypocrites who are so called because they show Islam, while hiding Kufr (disbelief). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: "We believe in Allâh and the Last Day" while in fact they believe not. They (think to) deceive Allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not! In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy)* [al-Baqarah: 8-10] (namely doubt and suspicion) *...and Allâh has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.* [al-Baqarah: 10] This theme is continued in the Ayahs following them in Surah Al-Baqarah. # These are the hypocrites who disbelieve in Allah and belie His Messengers (peace be upon them). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As-Salât (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little. (They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those* [an-Nisa: 142-143] # This means that they vacillate between the Kafirs (disbelievers) and the Muslims; at times they support the Kafirs when they prevail and achieve victory and at other times they support the believers when they prevail and achieve victory. They are not steadfast; their Din (religion) is not constant, and their Iman (Faith) is not solid. They waver between the state of Kufr and the state of Iman, and between the Kafirs and the Muslims. # Allah (Exalted be He) has disclosed their Kufr in His Saying: *And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and that they came not to As-Salât (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم); in reality Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.* [at-Tawbah: 54-55] Such are the hypocrites. # We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection.
9|1|Permanent Committee|Fatwas of the Permanent Committee No. 3810 Question 12|Question: # Why is not the Basmalah (i.e. “Bismillah Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim [In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful]”) written at the beginning of Surah Al-Tawbah? # Answer: # The reason behind this is reported by Ahmad and the Compilers of the Sunan (Hadith compilations by Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa’i and Ibn Majah) on the authority of ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: *I asked ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan, saying, “What made you put Al-Anfal which is one of the Mathany (Surahs containing less than one hundred Ayahs), next to Bara’ah (Al-Tawbah), which is one of the Mi’in (Surahs containing one hundred Ayahs), without writing the line ‘Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim’ in between them and you put it with the rest of Al-Sab‘ Al-Tiwal (the long seven Surahs)? What made you do so?” 'Uthman said, “There was a time when the Surahs that have a large number of Ayahs were revealed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) who used to call his scribes upon their revelation and tell them, ‘Put these Ayahs in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ And when an Ayah was revealed to him, he (peace be upon him) would also say, ‘Put this Ayah in the Surah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfal was one of the first Surahs that were revealed in Madinah, whereas Bara’ah (Al-Tawbah) was among the last revealed of the Qur’an. Its content was similar to that of Al-Anfal, therefore I thought that it was part of it. Moreover, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) died without clarifying for us whether it was indeed part of it; therefore, I put them next to one another, and I did not write the line ‘Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim’ between them, and I put it (Al-Tawbah) among Al-Sab‘ Al-Tiwal.*[1] # Footnote: #[1]: Musnad Ahmad pp. 1/57 and 1/69; Abu Dawud, nos. 786-787; Al-Tirmidhi no. 3086; and he said: "This is a hasan (good) Hadith"; Al-Mustadrak Al-Hakim p. 2/33; Sunan Al-Bayhaqi p. 2/42 and Al-Dala'il, vol. 7, no. 152; Ibn Abu Dawud [Al-Masahif] p. 2/39, and the writer of Al-Durr Al-Manthur attributed it to Ibn Abu Shaybah in Al-Musnad, Al-Nasa'i in Al-Sunan Al-Kubra; Ibn Al-Mundhir; Al-Nahas; Ibn Hibban; Abu Al-Shaykh; and Ibn Mardawaih p. 3/207.
9|4|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Al-Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz 8/290|Question: # What is the interpretation of the fourth Ayah mentioned in Surah Al-Tawbah. It reads: *Except those of the Mushrikûn (see V.2:105) with whom you have a treaty, and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their treaty to them for the end of their term. Surely Allâh loves Al-Mattaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2).* [At-Tawbah: 4] #Answer: #In this Ayah Allah (Exalted be He) commands His Messenger (peace be upon him) to complete the treaty which he concluded with the polytheists to its full term so long as they prove faithful to the terms of the treaty and abstain from giving support to the enemies of Muslims. In case they should breach the treaty or give support to the enemies of Muslims, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is obliged to engage in fight with them. When (the tribe of) Quraysh gave assistance to (the tribe of) Banu Bakr against (the tribe of) Khuza'ah, this was seen as a clear violation of the provisions of the treaty which the Prophet (peace be upon him) had signed with Quraysh and Banu Bakr. The Prophet (peace be upon him) fought them on the day he conquered Makkah. He entered Makkah and opened it by force in the eighth year of Hijrah (Prophet's migration to Madinah), because of their breach of the treaty. By the time Khuza'ah formed an alliance with the Prophet (peace be upon him), Banu Bakr had joined the Quraysh. Banu Bakr, without caring a bit for the provisions of the treaty, made a sudden attack against Khuza'ah though the latter was still in alliance with the Prophet (peace be upon him). They sought help from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and asked him to give them support against the attackers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) promised them victory. At that time Quraysh was providing Banu Bakr with property and arms. That is why the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought them and Allah (Exalted be He) helped him open Makkah. The treaty would have lasted for ten years, but the Quraysh breached it by giving help to Banu Bakr.

35|28|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/48|Question: # Please provide the (explanation/exegesis) of the Saying of Allah, *It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.* [Fatir: 28] # Answer: # This lofty Ayah indicates that those who possess knowledge about Allah, His Din (Religion), His Glorious Book, and the Sunnah of His Prophet have the most perfect fear of Allah (Glorified be He) among mankind. Thus, the Ayah means that those who have complete fear of Allah are those who know their Lord through His Names and Attributes and His Great Right and they are aware of His Shari‘ah (Divine Law) and believe in the blessings stored for those who fear Him and the punishment stored for those who forsake and disobey Him. Hence, because of their profound knowledge about Allah, they are the most fearful and reverential towards Allah; and at the head of them are the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and then their succeeding scholars who possess knowledge about Allah and His Din but their fear is in varying degrees. However, the Ayah does not mean that no one fears Allah except the scholars (those who possess knowledge). # All Muslims and believers, males and females, fear Allah, but their fear is in varying degrees and not of the same grade. Therefore, the more the believer possesses knowledge about Allah and comprehends His Din, the greater is their fear of Allah. If their knowledge is less, so is their understanding and awareness of Allah and His Din and subsequently their fear of Allah. Thus, people are of varying degrees in this matter and so are the scholars as already stated. The more there is knowledge about Din, the greater there is fear of Allah and the less there is knowledge about Din, the less there is fear of Allah. # That is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allâh, and in His Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) including all obligations ordered by Islâm] and do righteous good deeds, they are the best of creatures. Their reward with their Lord is ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity), underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever, Allâh will be pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.* [al-Bayyinah: 7-8] # Allah (Exalted be He) also says: *Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen (i.e. they do not see Him, nor His punishment in the Hereafter), theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise).* [al-Mulk: 12] # There are many Ayahs conveying this meaning. May Allah grant us success.
25|68|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/355, question no. 12|Question: # What is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: *And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allâh, nor kill such person as Allâh has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse - and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;* [al-Furqan: 68-69] Do these Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) mean that a person who commits all of the three mentioned major sins will abide in Hellfire forever or that applies to whoever commits only one of them? # Answer: # These great Ayahs warn against Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), Qatl (murder), and Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage). Thus, whoever commits all or any of these major sins is threatened by Allah’s Saying: *...and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.* [al-Furqan: 68] # The punishment is a valley in Hellfire according to one view or, as another opinion states, a grievous torment which is explained by Allah’s Saying: *The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;* [al-Furqan: 69] # At the same time, these three major sins have different degrees. # Shirk is the worst crime and the gravest sin. Whoever commits it will abide eternally in Hellfire and will never be brought out of it. The foregoing is explicitly stated by Allah (Exalted be He) in Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Tawbah: *It is not for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), to maintain the Mosques of Allâh (i.e. to pray and worship Allâh therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building,), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.* [at-Tawbah: 17] #*But if they had joined in worship others with Allâh, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.* [al-An'am: 88] # Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: *And indeed it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), as it was to those (Allâh’s Messengers) before you: "If you join others in worship with Allâh, (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.* [al-Zumar: 65] # Moreover, He (Exalted be He) tells about Mushriks (people who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship): *They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment.* [al-Maidah: 37] # There are many other Ayahs that indicate the same meaning. # Accordingly, Muslim scholars are unanimously agreed that a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who dies before making Tawbah (repentance to Allah) will abide eternally in Hellfire and will never be admitted to Jannah (Paradise) or forgiven. Allah (Exalted be He) says: *Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.* [al-Maidah: 72] # *Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills* [an-Nisa: 48] # Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) makes His Forgiveness forbidden to Mushriks and declares that all sins other than Shirk may or may not be forgiven subject to His Will. It is worthy to mention that among the types of Shirk that make a person (who had received Da‘wah 'calling to Islam' but did not repent before death) liable to abide eternally in Hellfire is to make Du‘a’ (supplication) to any of the deceased prophets, Awliya’ (pious people) or to the angels, Jinn (creatures created from fire), idols, stones, or stars. # Examples of making such Du‘a’s (supplications) are when some people say: "O my Master, I seek your protection, I defend myself by your power, support me, cure the diseased, help! Help!...and so on." Moreover, vowing or sacrificing for the sake of other than Allah (Exalted be He) is another type of Shirk that makes a person liable to the same punishment for all these are forms of ‘Ibadah (worship) that must not be offered to other than Allah, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.* [al-Isra: 23] #*And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, and that is the right religion.* [al-Bayyinah: 5] #*And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh.* [al-Jinn: 18] #Moreover, Allah (Exalted be He) teaches in Surah Al-Fatihah: *You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone)* [al-Fatihah: 5] # We ask for help (for each and everything). There are many other Ayahs to the same effect. # As for the second and third crimes i.e. murder and Zina, they are of less gravity than Shirk as long as their perpetrator does not regard them as being Halal (lawful), but they have been seduced by Satan to commit murder because of hatred or enmity; or to follow their whims and commit Zina while they know that murder - not for a just cause according to Islamic law - and Zina are Haram (prohibited). The perpetrators of such crimes (major sins) will abide temporarily in Hellfire, unless Allah (Exalted be He) forgives them because of specific good deeds they have done, Tawbah they made before they died, Shafa‘ah (intercession), or the Du‘a’ of other Muslims for them, besides other means for having sins forgiven. The case of the perpetrators of these two crimes is subject to Allah’s Will and Wisdom. Thus, many people will be punished for their sins, but will then be taken out of Hellfire by virtue of Allah’s Mercy (Glorified be He) either through Shafa‘ah, such as the special Shafa‘ah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) or that of angels, children who died before reaching puberty or believers. # Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) will bring them out of Hellfire by virtue of their Shafa‘ah for them after having spent the period that Allah (Exalted be He) decreed for them there. Nevertheless, a number of believers in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) will remain in Hellfire for not deserving Shafa‘ah; Allah shall bring them out of it just by His Mercy, for having died while believing in Tawhid and having faith in Him. However, they will be punished in Hellfire for their sins and bad deeds and when they are purified, Allah (Exalted be He) will take them out of Hellfire after the expiry of the period that He decreed for them to spend in the Fire. It is only by the Mercy of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) that they will sprout like a seed does in the silt carried by a flood and when they are fully recreated, He (Exalted be He) will admit them to Jannah. The foregoing is supported by more than one authentic Hadith Mutawatir (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). # Thus, it is clear that a sinner, such as a murderer or an adulterer, will not abide in Hellfire in the same manner as Kafirs (disbelievers) will, but only for a specific period of time that comes to an end, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *...and he will abide therein in disgrace* [al-Furqan: 69] This is only a temporary stay that differs from that of the Mushriks. The same applies to the threat which is given to whoever commits suicide. May Allah protect us.

The perpetrators of such crimes (major sins) will abide temporarily in Hellfire, unless Allah (Exalted be He) forgives them because of specific good deeds they have done, Tawbah they made before they died, Shafa‘ah (intercession), or the Du‘a’ of other Muslims for them, besides other means for having sins forgiven. The case of the perpetrators of these two crimes is subject to Allah’s Will and Wisdom. Thus, many people will be punished for their sins, but will then be taken out of Hellfire by virtue of Allah’s Mercy (Glorified be He) either through Shafa‘ah, such as the special Shafa‘ah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) or that of angels, children who died before reaching puberty or believers. # Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) will bring them out of Hellfire by virtue of their Shafa‘ah for them after having spent the period that Allah (Exalted be He) decreed for them there. Nevertheless, a number of believers in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) will remain in Hellfire for not deserving Shafa‘ah; Allah shall bring them out of it just by His Mercy, for having died while believing in Tawhid and having faith in Him. However, they will be punished in Hellfire for their sins and bad deeds and when they are purified, Allah (Exalted be He) will take them out of Hellfire after the expiry of the period that He decreed for them to spend in the Fire. It is only by the Mercy of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) that they will sprout like a seed does in the silt carried by a flood and when they are fully recreated, He (Exalted be He) will admit them to Jannah. The foregoing is supported by more than one authentic Hadith Mutawatir (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). # Thus, it is clear that a sinner, such as a murderer or an adulterer, will not abide in Hellfire in the same manner as Kafirs (disbelievers) will, but only for a specific period of time that comes to an end, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *...and he will abide therein in disgrace* [al-Furqan: 69] This is only a temporary stay that differs from that of the Mushriks. The same applies to the threat which is given to whoever commits suicide. May Allah protect us.
19|71|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/243, question no. 4|Question: # What is meant by His (Glorified be He) Saying, *And there is none of you except he will come to it.* [Maryam: 71] And does the phrase "will come to it" mean entering Hell or passing over the Sirat (the bridge over the Fire)? # Answer: # This phrase means passing over (the Sirat) as it was proved by authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him). Allah will save those who fear Allah and leave the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and wrongdoers therein humbled on their knees. Allah (Glorified be He) states, *Then We shall save those who used to fear Allâh and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrongdoers) therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell).* [Maryam: 72] #The disbelievers and sinners are to be led to the Sirat. The sinners will cross it according to their deeds: some will cross it safely, some will be snatched and then saved and some will be thrown into the Fire. However, they will not abide therein forever; they will be punished for a fixed period of time. The disbelievers will abide therein forever. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states in Surah Al-Baqarah concerning the disbelievers, *Thus Allâh will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.* [al-Baqarah: 167] #And in Surah Al-Ma'idah, *Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment. They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment.* [al-Maidah: 36-37] # There are many Ayahs to this effect. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection from the abode of the dwellers of the Hell.
48|10|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa 24/273|Question: # We attended a Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an) seminar held in a Masjid (mosque) called Abu Al-Haytham ibn Al-Tayhan and located in Salibiayh district in Kuwait. The Shaykh interpreted the Saying of Allah (whose meanings are translated as): *The Hand of Allâh is over their hands.* [Al-Fath: 10] He said that this Ayah has more than one meaning. It can be Allah's Help given to them, Allah's Power with them, or Allah's Knowledge of their conditions and intentions. After the seminar finished, one brother told the Shaykh that his interpretation of this Ayah goes against 'Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and complies with the views of Al-Asha'irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic). The Shaykh was annoyed and replied that Al-Mawardy and Ibn Kathir mentioned this interpretation in their books. The man corrected him saying that Ibn Kathir did not state that, but it is Al-Mawardy who advocated Asha'irah. # The debate heated and people behaved aggressively labeling the man a Christian and Buddhist and they were about to beat him but some protected him. Allah knows that this man wanted to explain the truth out of his jealousy for the Muslim 'Aqidah and the impermissibility of delaying the correction of an error beyond the proper time. The man suggested that the issue should be referred to you and they agreed. Would you please enlighten us. May Allah reward you the best. Waiting for your reply. # Answer: # Please be informed that our 'Aqidah is to affirm Allah's Attribute of having a Hand and the other attributes stated by Him in His Noble Book or by His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the purified Sunnah. However, this Hand is such as befits Allah's Majesty without Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah's Attributes) or Tamthil (likening Allah's Attributes to those of His Creation) or Tahrif (distortion of the meaning) or Ta'til (denial of Allah's Attributes). We believe that there is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. We do not deny any of His Attributes with which He described Himself. We do not remove the words from their correct places. We do not discuss the nature of His Attributes or liken His Attributes to those of His creation, because there is nothing that can be compared to Him, and He has no peer, equal or rival. Just as He (Glorified be He) has a true "Being" which is not similar to that of His creatures, He does not resemble any of His creatures in any of His Attributes. Confirming the Attributes of the Creator does not entail comparing them to those of the created. This is the doctrine of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) including the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), the Tabi'un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and their followers from the best three generations of Islam and their successors to this day. # The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) stated: More than one scholar reported that the Salaf unanimously agreed that the literal meanings of the Attributes of the Creator (Glorified and Exalted be He) should be accepted according to their apparent implications without any Takyif or Tashbih to the creatures. Discussing the Attributes comes under the heading of discussing the Divine Being. Whatever is said about the Divine Being can, in all respects, be said about the Divine Attributes. If the Divine Being is affirmed to exist without descriptive designation, the same applies to the Divine Attributes. We affirm the existence of every Attribute without describing its manner. We say that Allah (Exalted be He) has a Hand and Eyes, but we do not say that His Hand implies Power and His Hearing implies having knowledge. # Then the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted the following Ayah as evidence affirming Allah's Attribute of having a Hand: *The Jews say: “Allâh’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).” Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills.* [Al-Maidah: 64] # Allah (Exalted be He) also has said to Iblis (Satan): *What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands.* [Sad: 75] # He (Glorified be He) also says: *They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.* [Al-Zumar: 67] # Allah (Glorified be He) also says: *Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion* [Al-Mulk: 1] # Allah (Glorified be He) also says: *In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all things.* [Aal Imran: 26] # Then in commentary on these Ayahs, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) said: # These Ayahs mean that Allah (Exalted be He) has two Hands in a manner which suits His Majesty and that He created Adam with them unlike the angels and Iblis. Also, Allah (Exalted be He) will grasp the earth and fold the heavens in His Right Hand and that His both Hands are widely outstretched. The word outstretched implies generosity and free giving, for acts of generosity are usually performed with the hand stretched out, whereas when one refrains from giving the hands are clasped close to the neck, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: *And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.* [Al-Isra: 29] # Conventionally, when someone is described as having widely outstretched hands, it is understood that the person has hands in a true literal sense. Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) stated that the plural form of hand, i.e. hands is used to imply neither bounty nor power. Using the singular form to express numerous things or the plural form to express one thing is baseless in the Arabic language in which the Qur'an was revealed. Thus, Hands in His Saying: *...to one whom I have created with Both My Hands.* cannot mean power because the latter is one attribute. It is incorrect to use the plural form (hands) to express one thing (power). Nor do they imply bounty because we cannot use two hands to denote Allah's Bounties which are countless. # Then he (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted evidence from the Sunnah that affirms Allah's Attribute of having a Hand. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: *The just will be with Allah on pulpits of light on the right Hand of the Most Merciful (Glorified and Exalted be He), and both His Hands are right - those who are just in their judgment and are fair with their families and those of whom they are in charge.* (Related by Muslim) [1] # He (peace be upon him) also said: *Allah's Hand is full; never diminishes no matter how much is given, generously and unceasingly spending, night and day. Do you see what He has spent since He created the Heavens and the Earth? Yet all that has not decreased what is in His Hand. His Throne was over the water; and in His Other Hand there is the Balance; He raises and lowers (whom He wills).* (Related by Muslim) [2] # It is also reported in the Sahih (Authentic Hadith Book) on the authority of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: *The earth will be one single bread on the Day of Resurrection which the Almighty will turn in His Hand as one of you turns a loaf while on a journey.* [3] # It is also reported in the Sahih on the authority of Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: *'The Lord (Glorified and Exalted be He) will take in His Hand His heavens and earth and say, 'I am Allah - the Prophet (peace be upon him) clenched and opened his fingers (and continued narrating) - I am the King,' so much so that I looked at the Minbar (pulpit) and saw it moving underneath the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and thought that it would cause him (peace be upon him) to fall.* [4] # According to another narration: *While on the Minbar (pulpit), the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited the Ayah: "They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!" [Al-Zumar: 67] He (peace be upon him) said, 'Allah - glorifying Himself - will say: I am the Almighty.'* [5] # It is also reported in the Sahih on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: *Allah will hold the earth and fold the Heaven in His Right Hand, and say, 'I am the King! Where are the kings of the earth?'* [6] # Another authentic Hadith says: *(When Allah created Adam) Allah, keeping His Two Hands closed, said to him (Adam), 'Choose whichever you will.' Adam said, 'I choose the Right Hand of My Lord and both Hands of my Lord are blessed.' Then Allah spread out His Hand, and there were Adam and his offspring.* [7] # It is reported in the Sahih: *When Allah created the creation He wrote with His Hand on Himself: Verily, My Mercy overcomes My Wrath.* [8] # It is also reported in the Sahih: *There was an argument between Adam and Moses, in which Adam said to Moses, 'You are Moses! Allah chose you (above mankind) by His speaking to you and wrote with His own Hand the Torah for you.' Moses said, 'You are Adam! Allah has created you with His Hand and breathed into you the soul He created for you.'* [9] # It is reported that Allah (Exalted be He) says: *By My Majesty and Glory, I will not make the righteous offspring of those whom I created with My Hands like those (other creatures) to whom I said, 'Be' and they were.* [10] # It is reported in the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes): *Allah created Adam and wiped his back with His Right Hand, and brought forth from it an offspring, saying, 'I have created these for Paradise and the deeds of the people of Paradise they will be doing.' He then wiped his back and brought forth from it an offspring, saying, 'I have created these for Hellfire, and the deeds of the people of Hellfire they will be doing.'* [11] # The Shaykh of Islam stated that these Hadiths and others stand as decisive texts closed to Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation). They were accepted and authenticated by the Muslim Ummah (nation). The Qur'an and Sunnah many times mention Allah's Attribute of having a Hand including that He (Exalted be He) created with His Hand, His Hands are widely outstretched and the dominion is in His Hand. Also, the Sunnah is replete with mention of this attribute. It is impossible that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the Imams omitted to explain to people that these texts do not imply the apparent meaning or should not be interpreted in the literal sense. That this continued until Jahm ibn Safwan came a long time after the era of Sahabah to explain to people what was revealed to their Prophet (peace be upon him)! Then Bishr ibn Ghiyath followed his path and other people accused of hypocrisy imitated him. # The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us everything, even how to perform Istinja' (cleansing the private parts with water after urination or defecation). He (peace be upon said) said: "**I have left nothing which can lead you to Paradise except that I explained it to you. I have left you on white (clear) proof; its night is like its day. None shall deviate from it after me except that he is destroyed.**" It is illogical that after that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would ignore the claim that apparent meanings of the texts contained in the Book and Sunnah imply Tajsim (anthropomorphism) and Tashbih and that whoever believe in the apparent meanings is misguided without explaining or manifesting the truth. It is also impossible that the Salaf would say that we should accept these texts as they were revealed while they intended the metaphorical meaning. If they had metaphorically implied certain attributes, the Arabs would have realized this. Persians and Romans cannot be more knowledgeable of Arabic language than the sons of Al-Muhajirun (Emigrants from Makkah to Madinah) and Al-Ansar (Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet).

68|42|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/355, question no. 16|Question: # What is the Tafsir (explanation/exegesis of the meanings) of Allah's Statement: *(Remember) the Day when the Shin shall be laid bare (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) and they shall be called to prostrate themselves (to Allâh), but they (hypocrites) shall not be able to do so.* [al-Qalam: 42]? # Answer: # The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) explained this Ayah (Qur'anic verse) saying that Allah (Glorified be He) will come on the Day of Resurrection and reveal His Shin to His believing Slaves. It will be a sign for the believers, which when He reveals, they will know Him and follow Him. The Noble Ayah should be understood according to what was mentioned in the Hadith, which is Allah's revealing of His Shin. This is one of the Attributes such as befits Allah's (Glorified and Exalted be He) Majesty and Grandeur that does not resemble any of His Creation in any way. # The same applies to other Attributes, such as His Face, His Hands, His Foot, His Eyes, and other Attributes which are authentically established in Nusus (Islamic texts from the Qur’an or the Sunnah). Also, anger, love, hatred, and all Attributes with which He has described Himself in the Noble Qur'an and which the Prophet (peace be upon him) reported. Allah (Exalted be He) says: *There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.* [ash-Shura: 11] # Allah (Exalted be He) says: *Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "He is Allâh, (the) One. "Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. "He begets not, nor was He begotten. "And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him."* [al-Ikhlas: 1-4] # This is the opinion adopted by Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the scholars who followed them in righteousness. May Allah grant us success.
12|106|Ibn Baz|Majmu' Fatawa wa Maqalat 5/355 (question no. 18) and 8/292|Question 1: # Allah (Exalted be He) says: *And most of them believe not in Allâh except that they attribute partners unto Him [i.e. they are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6: 121].* [Yusuf: 106] What is the meaning of this Ayah? What is meant by "attributing partners unto Him"? # Answer 1: # Scholars like Ibn 'Abbas and others explained that this Ayah means that whenever asked who created the heavens and the earth, the unbelievers would say *It is Allah*. Yet, they worshipped idols like Al-Lat, Al-'Uzza, and other deities. They called on them for help and sacrificed animals for their pleasure. Their declaration of Allah's Power confirms their belief in Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah's Lordship, Allah being the only Lord). However, attributing partners to Allah (Exalted be He) renders this belief null and void and of no benefit for them. Abu Jahl and his likes believed in Allah as their Creator and Sustainer and that He created the heavens and the earth. But this belief availed them nothing because they ascribed partners to Allah by worshipping idols. This is the meaning of the Ayah according to what is reported from the eminent Muslim scholars. # Question 2: #Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: *And most of them believe not in Allâh except that they attribute partners unto Him [i.e. they are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6: 121].* [Yusuf: 106] What is the Tafsir (explanation/exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an) of this Ayah (Qur'anic verse)? What does Shirk mean here? #Answer 2: #Its meaning is explained by many scholars, such as Ibn 'Abbas and others. What it means is that when the polytheists are asked who created the heavens and earth, and who created them, they say Allah, yet despite this they worship idols and statues like Al-Lat, Al-'Uzzah and others, they seek help from them, and they make vows and offer sacrifices to them. This Iman (Faith/belief) of theirs is Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah's Lordship), but it is invalidated and corrupted by their Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and does not avail them anything. Abu Jahl and his like believed that Allah was their Creator and Provider, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, but this did not avail them anything, because they associated others with Allah by worshipping idols and statues. This is the meaning of the Ayah according to the scholars.
